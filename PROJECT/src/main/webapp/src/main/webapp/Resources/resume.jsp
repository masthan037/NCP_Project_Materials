			    	<p class="p1">When it comes to resume design there is only one question that matters: is it easy to read? It needs to be, so if it’s not here's what you need to do. Use an uncluttered, organized template (a great place to find free resume templates is Canva, but a google search will bring you dozens of online options), and clearly define your sections for easy reading. When it comes to font and color, keep it pretty basic. If you’re applying for a creative opportunity you can take some liberty with the aesthetics to show you have an eye for design, but don’t get crazy, your portfolio should do a great job of showcasing your talent. Lastly, keep it short and sweet. As mentioned before, employers are reading these resumes at light speed so be sure to cut the fat. Only include the most relevant experience and try to limit your resume to one page. That may be a stretch for more senior applicants but it is a pretty solid rule of thumb.</p>
			    	<p class="p2">Content and design are the two main components of building a resume but certainly not the only areas that can add to a resume. Check out our full list of tips and tricks below:</p>
			    	
			    	<ol>
			    	<li>Be sure to use tenses that match throughout your entire resume. You never want to start in the present tense and then suddenly switch to the past tense. You also want to avoid describing yourself in third person.</li>
					<li>Always keep your typography and format consistent. For example, make sure you have both the year and month when you start and finish a position.</li>
					<li>Use action words at the beginning of sentences and describe how you used a certain technology, tool or skill in each job; developed, implemented, directed, etc. </li>
					<li>Write the job details in bullet form. This will make your resume easier to read and navigate.</li>
					<li>Be clear and concise with everything you write. Minimize the number of bullet points for each job; there is no need to include every single detail, just include the relevant points. </li>
					<li>List more of what you’ve accomplished and how you helped the business, opposed to everyday responsibilities. Future employers typically like to see the impact you had on other companies, so they can have a better understanding of what you could bring to theirs.</li>
			    	</ol>
			    	
			    	<p>Lastly; proofread, proofread, PROOFREAD! Read it twice, send it to a friend or colleague to review, then read it again. Grammar and spelling mistakes on a resume is a step in the wrong direction. If you’re qualified for the position don’t let an editing mistake take you out of the running.</p>
			    	<p>So remember; keep it short, keep it organized, and tailor your resume. When you land that interview, check out how to stand out from the other candidates, and nail it. Good luck on your job hunt! </p>
